* **Linear Hypothesis Test**
- "Makes performing a linear hypothesis test on any subset of predictors/exogenous variables in a multiple linear regression model easy using a dialog box and minimal effort from the end-user."
- "Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning Studio is a data science platform and tool with a graphical user interface that lets data scientists create data science solutions."
- "R is an open-source statistical programming language."

* **Overview**
- "Using any multiple linear regression model, performs a linear hypothesis test on any subset of explanatory/exogenous variables.  Utilizes the 'Custom R Script' node in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio, which suipplies as dialog box to help the end-user."
- "Useful for exploring the relationship between a single target variable and many individual or subsets of explanatory variables."
- "Useful if the number of explanatory variables is very large, and a dialog box for keeping track of included variables is helpful."
- "Not useful is needing a dataframe or matrix output, this project produces a table of values that informs the data scientist about what variables to include in the pipeline, preferably separate from a node with this script."

* **Getting Started**
- Installation
  - "You will need to install the R shell, which is responsible for compiling and running the R script."
